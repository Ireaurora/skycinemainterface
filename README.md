I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a web page which simulates the holographic devices used in futuristic films. 

I used youtube to show a video. I programmed this to ensure that the navigation bar that usually appears in youtube wouldn’t show. I did this because the shape containing the video is already small therefore introducing the navigation bar would make it even smaller, not showing the video to its full potential.
I also decided to show the video continuously in order to ensure that youtube wouldn’t propose to watch a new video.

I created an area where the user can decide the genre of the movie they want to watch.

I used a Google API to get an image of the google map showing the United Kingdom. The position can be easily changed by changing the coordinates.

I used JavaScript in order to light up different elements on the web page. I decided ìto light up the central shapes completely by changing their background color, whereas for the movie images, I thought it was best to change the color of their borders in order to show a light up keeping the graphics and design of the image intact.

In order to ensure that this interface is user-friendly, I decided to show the command keys needed to light up the various elements at the start, as soon as the page is loaded. This helps the user to have an initial understanding of how the web pages works and what it offers. 
In addition I created  “help” button that will remind the user of the command keys in case the user needs a reminder without having to re-load the page, losing pieces of information they loaded.


NEXT STEPS:
-Linkthe genre chosen with the sky page listing the movies for that genre.

-Create a file system containing all the new movies that Sky Cinema is offering. 

-Provide the user with an interface where they could choose a genre 

-Using the Google Maps API, choose the location of where the chosen movie is set in.  This means that the user would be able to choose a family movie which was set in California.

-Add a slideshow in the initial page
